Persephone-web-API v0.0.1 (beta version)
========================================

This is a web API for the the `persephone library <https://github.com/persephone-tools/persephone>`_

This is a REST API that will provide the ability to interact with the Persephone transcription tools from over the network.

This API is based on the `OpenAPI 2.0 <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md>`_ (formerly known as Swagger) standard which specifies API endpoints via API description files.
The API specification for this project can be found in a YAML file located in the repository at `./persephone_api/api_spec.yaml <https://github.com/persephone-tools/persephone-web-API/blob/master/persephone_api/api_spec.yaml>`_

This file will show you all the endpoints that are supported but an easier way to get familiarity with the API is to use the API explorer frontend provided by the project. See the API explorer section of this README to get started with exploring the API.

For more information about the API specification see the `documentation page <https://persephone-web-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/APIspecification.html>`_.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found `here <https://persephone-web-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Installation
------------

You can install this package directly or use Docker.

Docker
~~~~~~
First make sure that you have docker installed on your machine.
Here's some steps to do that on Ubuntu:

.. code:: bash

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    sudo apt-get update

This will add the docker repository to your package manager lists.
Make sure that the package that is the candidate to be installed is the newly added one and not the ubuntu package via this command:

.. code:: bash

    apt-cache policy docker-ce

If this has worked correctly you'll see an output such as this:

.. code::

    docker-ce:
      Installed: (none)
      Candidate: 18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu
      Version table:
     *** 18.06.1~ce~3-0~ubuntu 500
            500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages
            100 /var/lib/dpkg/status
         18.06.0~ce~3-0~ubuntu 500
            500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages
         18.03.1~ce-0~ubuntu 500
            500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu xenial/stable amd64 Packages


Note that there is no package installed but the candidate for installation is from the Docker repository which is what we want.

Now install Docker with this command:

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce


If the install has been successful then you should be able to see the Docker process running.
Check with this command

.. code:: bash

    sudo systemctl status docker

In a successful case the output should look like this:

.. code::

    ● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
       Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
       Active: active (running) since Mon 2018-10-15 16:52:50 AEDT; 25min ago
         Docs: https://docs.docker.com
     Main PID: 9841 (dockerd)
        Tasks: 41
       Memory: 52.4M
          CPU: 9.557s
       CGroup: /system.slice/docker.service
               ├─9841 /usr/bin/dockerd -H fd://
               └─9868 docker-containerd --config /var/run/docker/containerd/containerd.toml

If you wish to not use `sudo` to invoke docker, add your user to the Docker group with the following command:

.. code:: bash

    sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

Note that you may have to log out and back in again for this to work

Then verify that the install has been successful via running a real container:

.. code:: bash

    docker run hello-world


Build the container:

.. code:: bash

    docker build -t persephone-web-api:dev .

Run it:

.. code:: bash

    docker run -p 8080:8080/tcp persephone-web-api:dev


Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a Vagrantfile for automating the build and install of the development environment.
This is recommended as it is likely the easiest way to get set up with a development environment as packages will be correctly installed.

To get Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/

To start and provisions the vagrant environment:

.. code:: sh

    vagrant up

Once that has installed you can access via ssh:

.. code:: sh

    vagrant ssh

The code resides at the `/vagrant` directory, set up the environment via pipenv:

.. code:: sh

    cd /vagrant
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    python transcription_api_server.py

If all has worked you should be able to point your browser at 127.0.0.1:8080 and you will see the page being served.

Direct install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package requires Python 3.5 or higher.

There are some 3rd party requirements that have to be installed in order to use this, these can be found in the file "bootstrap.sh".

Currently you will need to set up a virtualenvironment and install package requirements.
You can do this as follows:

.. code:: sh

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

At this point you should have the packages required to run this API server.

(Note that the Docker image is just an automated version of this direct install)

Usage
-----

This server uses the Flask framework to service API endpoints.

Make sure you are in the active virtualenvironment and run the transcription server as follows:

.. code:: sh

	python3 transcription_API_server.py

This will start up a web server that will service the endpoints defined by the API.

Test that this server is functional by pointing your browser at the URL that pages are being served from.

API explorer
------------

Since this uses `OpenAPI 2.0 <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md>`_ (formerly known as Swagger) API specification we have tooling that will help you to explore the API.
This tooling creates and hosts a web frontend that shows you the various API endpoints and provides you forms to test these endpoints from your browser.
Load up the API explorer page by navigating to `/v0.1/ui/` (Note that the version prefix will depend on the version of the API being served).

If you find yourself needing to construct more complex web requests we would recommend you look into a tool such as `Postman <https://www.getpostman.com/>`_ for ease of API testing.
